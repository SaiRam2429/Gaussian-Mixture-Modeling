# Gaussian-Mixture-Modeling

### The directory consists of four files:
   * The first one is the Notebook
   * The text file **netflix_complete.txt** consist of the actual reviews given by the user.
   * The text file **netflix_incomplete.txt** consist of intentionally removed user reviews.
   * The text file **post.txt consists** of posterior probabilites calculated by the Gaussian.

- This is an Unsupervised learning problem.
- Our job is to predict the missing entries for a user using the *Gaussian mixture modeling* algorithm and *Collaborative filtering technique*.
